## Setup
:floppy_disk:

Uses the following tools in this repository:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  - Open-source, declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Itâ€™s maintained by Facebook, and it can be used to develop of single-page applications (SPA).
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
  - GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.
- [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/)
  - Open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including Apollo Client. Uses apollo-server-express package to integrate GraphQL into Express.js server, and the @apollo/client package to make requests from React front end to the GraphQL API.
- [React Router](https://graphql.org/)
  - Collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with the application, allowing single-page React applications behave more like multi-page applications.
- [concurrently](https://graphql.org/)
  - Runs multiple processes, or servers, from a single command-line interface, rather than opening multiple terminals to start multiple servers. Tracks multiple outputs in one place and will stop all processes if one fails.
- [jsonwebtoken](https://graphql.org/)
  - JSON Web Tokens, or JWTs, are an alternative to using session cookies for authentication.
- [jwt-decode](https://graphql.org/)
  - Helps decode JWTs from their Base64Url encoding. Extracts non-sensitive data such as token's expiration date to see if it's expired before making a request to the server.
- [faker](https://graphql.org/)
  - Generates massive amounts of fake data in the development environment of your Node.js applications.
- [nodemon](https://graphql.org/)
  - Simplifies development environment by automatically restarting Node.js applications when file changes in the directory are detected.
